	<h2>Explanation</h2>
	<p>
	  One of my assignments for a Web Technologies class at USC was to write the front and backends of a weather webapp. The frontend uses Angular with TypeScript, and the backend uses NodeJS with the Express framework. Both the front and backends are hosted on Azure. The backend mostly acts as a "pass-through" layer that implemented its own RESTful API called by the frontend. All of the RESTful API calls would use the information passed from the frontend to make calls to 3rd party RESTful APIs for things like weather queries or database I/O, and pass the returned information, either entirely or with slight modification, back to the frontend.
